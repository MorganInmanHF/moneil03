Hello! 
I graduated from Purdue University with a Bachelor of Science in HR Management and I’ve been in the healthcare talent acquisition industry for nearly 7 years. 
I have mostly worked on nurse and allied health recruitment with some high volume as well.
I'm excited to start my journey with IT recruitment.
I pride myself on presenting quality candidates that show the potential to grow, develop, commit, and excel in their positions!
